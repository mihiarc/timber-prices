# Timber Markets of the United States

Timber markets are defined by **forest type and products**, not just geography. The same state may participate in multiple distinct markets based on the species present and products demanded.

## Key Insight

> "The northern hardwood market of the Lake States is distinct from the softwood pulp markets of Maine."

States like Michigan participate in **three** distinct markets:
- Northern hardwood sawtimber (maple, beech, birch)
- Aspen pulpwood (OSB, paper)
- Spruce-fir pulpwood (paper, packaging)

These markets have different buyers, price dynamics, and drivers.

## The 9 Timber Categories

**8 Private Forest-Type Markets** + **1 Administered Public System**

### The 8 Private Markets

### Pulpwood Markets

#### Aspen Pulp
Lake States pulpwood market. Characterized by:
- Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan
- Quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, paper birch
- OSB, paper, packaging
- Short rotation (40 years)
- **Distinct market from northern hardwood sawtimber**
- 65% private ownership

**Geographic zones:** Lake States Aspen

### National Forest System (Administered Pricing)

The National Forest System is **not a true market**. It's an administered pricing system with:

- **Appraised stumpage values** (not market-discovered prices)
- **Policy constraints** (NFMA, ESA, Roadless Rule, litigation)
- **Non-market objectives** (recreation, watershed, wildlife)
- **Road credits** and stewardship contracts affecting effective price
- **Salvage sales** with different economics

#### USFS Administrative Regions

| Region | Name | States | Timber Significance |
|--------|------|--------|---------------------|
| R1 | Northern | MT, ID (north) | High |
| R2 | Rocky Mountain | CO, WY, SD, NE | Moderate |
| R3 | Southwestern | AZ, NM | Low |
| R4 | Intermountain | UT, NV, ID (south), WY | Moderate |
| R5 | Pacific Southwest | CA | High (historically) |
| R6 | Pacific Northwest | OR, WA | High (historically) |
| R8 | Southern | 13 Southern states | Moderate |
| R9 | Eastern | 20 NE/Midwest states | Moderate |
| R10 | Alaska | AK | Moderate |

#### Why Track National Forest Separately?

1. **Different data sources** - USFS Cut & Sold reports, not private surveys
2. **Different price discovery** - Appraisal vs. market bidding
3. **Policy-driven supply** - Not responsive to price signals
4. **Significant in West** - 60%+ of timberland is federal in some states
5. **Different products** - Includes restoration, hazardous fuels reduction

#### States with Significant NF Timber (>20% of harvest)

```
MT, ID, OR, WA, CA, AK, CO, AZ, NM

## Why Forest-Type Markets?

### Research Support

Hood & Dorfman (2015) found that timber markets are **not fully integrated** even within the U.S. South. Markets defined by forest type capture:

1. **Product differentiation** - Pulpwood vs. sawtimber have different buyers
2. **Species substitutability** - Pine and oak are not interchangeable
3. **Mill infrastructure** - Pulp mills vs. sawmills serve different markets
4. **Price co-movement** - Prices within a forest-type market move together

### Practical Implications

- **Price analysis**: Compare like with like (spruce-fir pulp to spruce-fir pulp)
- **Supply modeling**: Forest type determines available products
- **Demand modeling**: Mills demand specific species/products
- **Investment analysis**: Returns vary by market, not just geography
