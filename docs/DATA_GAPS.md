## New Hampshire

### Current Status
- **Coverage**: 1985-2011 (Figshare/NHTOA Timber Crier data)
- **Gap**: 2012-2024 (13 years)

### Issue
The NH Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) publishes semi-annual stumpage values, but their website has **Akamai bot protection** that blocks automated downloads. Data exists for 2021-2025 online but must be downloaded manually via browser.

### Potential Solutions

1. **Manual Download (2021-2025)** - IMMEDIATE
   - URL: https://www.revenue.nh.gov/taxes-glance/timber-tax/average-stumpage-value-information
   - Download all available PDFs via browser
   - Save to `data/raw/nh_dra/pdfs/`
   - Run parser: `uv run python scripts/parse_nh_dra_stumpage.py`

2. **Request Historical Data (2012-2020)**
   - Contact: NH DRA Property Appraisal Division
   - Phone: (603) 203-5950
   - Email: Forms@dra.nh.gov
   - Request: Archived Average Stumpage Value PDFs

3. **NHTOA Quarterly Survey**
   - Contact: cbirch@nhtoa.org
   - May have compiled data from their quarterly surveys

### Data Format (NH DRA PDFs)
- Semi-annual publication (Apr-Sep, Oct-Mar)
- Three regions: Northern, Central, Southern NH
- Low and high stumpage values by species
- Units: $/MBF, $/Cord, $/Ton

## Tennessee (PARTIALLY RESOLVED)

### Current Status
- **Coverage**: 2009-2025 (605 records)
- **Gap**: 2018-2022 (5 years)

### Resolution (2023-2025)
The Tennessee State Forest Timber Sales Archive provides actual bid data from state forest timber sales, including volumes and winning bid amounts. Stumpage prices were calculated by dividing bid by volume.

1. **Data Source**: TN State Forest Timber Sale Archive
   - URL: https://www.tn.gov/agriculture/forests/state-forests/timber-sale-archive.html
   - Data extracted: FY 2023, 2024, 2025 (49 timber sales)

2. **Parser Created**: `scripts/parse_tn_timber_sales.py`
   - Extracts sale ID, state forest, volume (BF), winning bid
   - Calculates price per MBF = bid / (volume / 1000)
   - Aggregates by year and timber type

3. **Integration**: `scripts/integrate_tn_forestry.py`
   - Added 8 aggregated records (3 years × ~3 timber types)
   - Combined with existing 2009-2017 TN Forest Products Bulletin data
   - Total: 605 TN records

### Data Coverage
- **Years**: 2009-2025 (with 2018-2022 gap)
- **Species**: Hardwood (~$544/MBF), Pine (~$217/MBF), Mixed (~$307/MBF)
- **Product**: Sawtimber (Doyle Rule board feet)
- **State Forests**: Chuck Swan, Chickasaw, Natchez Trace, Standing Stone, Prentice Cooper, Franklin, Lone Mountain, Pickett, Lewis

### Remaining Gap (2018-2022)
The Tennessee Forest Products Bulletin **ceased publication in 2017**. For 2018-2022 data:

1. **TimberMart-South (Recommended)**
   - Commercial subscription service
   - Has quarterly data from 1976-present for Tennessee
   - Contact: tmart@timbermart-south.com, 706-247-7660

2. **Contact Tennessee Division of Forestry**
   - David Neumann: David.Neumann@tn.gov, 615-837-5334
   - May have unpublished internal data

## Kentucky

### Current Status
- **Coverage**: 2024 Q3-Q4 only (530 records)
- **Gap**: All other periods

### Issues
1. **Image-based PDFs**: Most Kentucky reports are scanned images, not text-extractable
2. **Delivered prices only**: Kentucky publishes delivered log prices, not stumpage
3. **Not in TimberMart-South**: Kentucky is outside the 11-state coverage area

### Potential Solutions

1. **OCR Implementation**
   - Use Tesseract or cloud OCR to parse image-based PDFs
   - PDFs available: 2020-2025

2. **Delivered-to-Stumpage Conversion**
   - Stumpage is typically 30-50% of delivered prices
   - Use 50% reduction as conservative estimate

3. **Contact Kentucky Division of Forestry**
   - Stewart M. West: (502) 782-7179
   - Request historical delivered log price reports

### Important Notes
- Kentucky data represents **delivered prices at mill**, not stumpage
- For stumpage estimation, apply 50% reduction factor
- Notes field should clearly indicate: "Estimated from delivered prices"

---

## California

### Current Status
- **Coverage**: 2019-2025 (1,890 records from CDTFA)
- **Gap**: 2009-2018 (10 years)

### Issue
CDTFA harvest values schedules from 2009-2018 are not publicly archived online. USFS PNW data ends at 2008 for California.

### Potential Solutions

1. **Contact CDTFA**
   - Phone: 916-309-8560
   - Request archived Harvest Values Schedules for 2009-2018

2. **California Board of Equalization Archives**
   - Historical stumpage reports used for yield tax
   - May have older data

3. **UC Cooperative Extension**
   - Historical analysis available through 2012
   - Contact for unpublished data

### Notes
- CDTFA values are tax assessment values, not market prices
- Apply adjustments for logging system, volume, etc.

## Georgia

### Current Status
- **Coverage**: 2024-2025 (2,862 records from GA DOR)
- **Gap**: Historical data

### Issue
Only 2 years of structured GA DOR data available in parsed form. UGA Extension outlook PDFs exist but contain narrative data (not tables).

### Potential Solutions

1. **TimberMart-South**
   - Has quarterly Georgia data from 1976-present
   - Commercial subscription required

2. **Parse UGA Extension PDFs**
   - `uga_timber_outlook_2024.pdf`, `uga_timber_outlook_2025.pdf`
   - Contains quarterly market analysis (narrative form)

3. **Contact GA DOR**
   - Request historical Owner Harvest Timber Value reports
